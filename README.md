# Phoenix_Temps
The purpose of this program and its outputs are for academic purposes only.

The program makes use of Phoenix Sky Harbor daily temperature readings since 1948 as captured by the NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Adminstration) from https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/

It makes use of ggridges and ggplot2 geom_dotplot to makes fun graphs and then stitches them together via ImageMagick.
Also then shows how to do some simple facet_wrap'ing
